% MAJOR SECTION: SUMMARY
%
\section{Summary}
I am a Mathematics and Computer Science joint honours undergraduate student at
The University of York, currently averaging over 90\% in academic disciplines.
In addition to having a keen and long-established interest in Pure Mathematics
and Theoretical Computer Science, I am well-versed in a diverse range of
practical technologies including C, Java, Haskell, \LaTeX{}, Wolfram
\textit{Mathematica}, and a variety of scripting languages.

% MAJOR SECTION: EXPERIENCE AND TECHNICAL SKILLS
%
\section{Experience and Technical Skills}
Whilst I am constantly concerned with the continual development of my commercial
and managerial aptitude, a wide variety of experiences have allowed me to
ascertain a significant set of skills bound to be invaluable to any employer:
\begin{itemize}
        \item Expertise---substantiated by over a decade's experience---in the C
        programming language. Some expositions of relevant work can be found on
        GitHub and my University website:
        \begin{itemize}
                \item \weblink{pss}{Programming Support Sessions}: During my
                tenure as the Technical Officer of The University of York
                Electronics Society (\textit{ShockSoc}) in the Autumn and Spring
                terms of 2022, I compiled and delivered a full course of the C
                programming language to cohorts of undergraduate students
                studying Electronic Engineering.

                \item \githublink{calculator-demo}{An Infix Arithmetic
                Expression Evaluator}: This project includes a reference
                implementation of the Shunting Yard algorithm, stack-based
                evaluation, and various other commonly techniques including
                memory management and the implementation of abstract data types.
                Implementations in C and Java are included.

                \item \weblink{fractal}{A Hardware-Accelerated Generalised
                Fractal Renderer}: This product, coupled with a large report,
                was written for an A-Level Computer Science qualification,
                however continues to be maintained in a limited capacity. Using
                C, OpenGL, and assembly language on a 64-bit Linux platform, the
                final product was capable of rendering highly customisable
                self-similar two-dimensional fractals to an X11 window using
                distributed computing paradigms.

                \item \gistlink{}{GitHub Gists Library}: A collection of modular
                and extensible implementations of canonical algorithms and
                abstract data structures which pervade classical Computer
                Science and Software Engineering. Selected contributions
                include a high-performance \texttt{popcount} (zero-counting)
                benchmarking toolkit, and an optimised implementation of a
                string-formatter, emulating the behaviour of a complex and
                heavyweight \texttt{printf} standard library feature.
        \end{itemize}
        \item A matured acquaintance with the \TeX\ and \LaTeX\ typesetting
        systems. In addition to the aforementioned Programming Support Session
        scripts, which were wholly set with \LaTeX, I have an array of similarly
        technical document-preparation projects:
        \begin{itemize}
                \item \githublink{MS1GP}{\textit{Mathematical Skills} Group
                Project}: A small set of documents covering Category Theory,
                with a particular focus on its parallels to functional
                programming and The $\lambda$-Calculus. The repository
                principally includes a report and large \textit{Beamer}
                presentation. Throughout both mediums, abstract concepts are
                substantiated with concrete examples in the purely functional
                Haskell programming language, in which I am also fluent. A
                collection of Bash shell scripts was also developed to
                facilitate effective management and deployment of this project.
                \todomark{This repository will be publicised once the MS1 marks
                have been ratified by the Board of Examiners.}

                \item \githublink{cv}{Curriculum Vitae}: The sources of my CV
                demonstrate understanding of imperative and declarative design
                principles for non-trivial typesetting tasks.

                \item \githublink{opium}{A Humanities and Social Sciences
                Essay}: Having conceptualised and developed a large essay for an
                A-Level \textit{AQA History} qualification, I also possess
                reasonable experience with typesetting large amounts of
                non-technical prose for professional delivery; this includes the
                setting of non-Latin scripts including Standard Chinese and
                Cyrillic.
        \end{itemize}
        \item A familiarity with the Wolfram \textit{Mathematica} technical
        computing system, particularly in the research areas of Automated
        Theorem-Proving and Distributed Workflows. A small cache of
        \textit{Mathematica} notebooks, published to demonstrate moderate
        competence in the Wolfram Language, can be found on
        \weblink{misc\_mma}{my University web instance}.
