\phantomsection\addcontentsline{toc}{section}{Summary}
I am a Mathematics and Computer Science joint honours undergraduate student at
the University of York, currently seeking a Year in Industry while averaging
over 80\% in academic disciplines. In addition to having a keen and
long-established interest in Mathematics and Theoretical Computer Science,
I am well-versed in a diverse range of practical technologies including C, C++,
Java, Haskell, \LaTeX{}, SQL, Python, and a variety of other scripting
languages. These act in complement to my demonstrable abilities in strong
leadership, communication, and organisation. I am enthusiastic to participate
in a high-pressure and client-oriented environment, and I anticipate to exploit
my problem-solving and analytical skills, gained through the study of
Mathematics and a decade of software-development experience, to devise efficient
solutions that satisfy clients' criteria.

            English and Mathematics.
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\section{Experience and Technical Skills}
Whilst I am constantly concerned with the continual development of my commercial
and managerial aptitude, a wide variety of experiences has allowed me to
ascertain a significant set of skills bound to be invaluable to any employer.
\begin{itemize}
    \item Expertise---substantiated by over a decade's experience---in the C,
        C++, and Java programming languages, the latter of which have allowed me
        to form a solid understanding of modern object-oriented design patterns.
        Some expositions of relevant work can be found on GitHub and my
        University website; brief descriptions are provided below.
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \weblink{pss}{Programming Support Sessions}: During my tenure as
        the Technical Director of the University of York Electronics Society
        (\textit{EngSoc}, formerly \textit{ShockSoc}) throughout 2022, I
        compiled and delivered a full course of the C programming language to
        large cohorts of undergraduate students studying various branches of
        Engineering.

        During the orchestration of this project, in the interests of securing a
        successful execution, I demonstrated impeccable long-term organisational
        and leadership skills: this included administration of the Societal and
        Departmental assets, and management of all interested parties.

        \item \githublink{calculator-demo}{A Work-In-Progress Computer Algebra
        System}: This project unifies efficient and refined implementations of
        algorithms that are integral for mathematical computing applications,
        such as the parsing of expressions and stack-based evaluation. The
        codebase is under active development, with the eventual goal of
        producing a comprehensive system capable of general technical computing.

        \item \weblink{fractal}{A Hardware-Accelerated Fractal Renderer}: This
        product, coupled with a large report, was written for an A-level
        Computer Science qualification, however continues to be maintained in a
        limited capacity. Using C, OpenGL, and assembly language on a 64-bit
        Linux platform, the final product was capable of rendering
        parametrisable fractals using distributed computing paradigms.

        \item \gistlink{}{GitHub Gists Library}: A collection of modular and
        extensible implementations of canonical algorithms and abstract data
        structures which pervade classical Computer Science and Software
        Engineering. Selected contributions include a Hamming Weight
        benchmarking toolkit, an optimised implementation of a string-formatter,
        and a visual demonstration of dynamic allocation, intended for the
        education of undergraduate Computer Science and Electronic Engineering
        students.
    \end{itemize}
    \item Through my long involvement in open-source communities, and working in
    University special-interest societies, I have established an understanding
    of foundational team-based development processes including agile and
    continuous techniques. I strongly value, and continually endeavour to
    improve, the qualities of efficient communication amongst small teams when
    working collaboratively: this includes experience with unit testing in a
    large selection of languages, including for projects using multiple stacks
    requiring uniform testing.

    \item A matured acquaintance with the \TeX\ and \LaTeX\ typesetting systems.
    In addition to the aforementioned Programming Support Session scripts, which
    were wholly set with \LaTeX, I have an array of similarly technical
    document-preparation projects:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \githublink{MS1GP}{\textit{Mathematical Skills} Group Project}: A
        small set of documents covering Category Theory, with a particular focus
        on its parallels to functional programming. The repository includes a
        report and large presentation, throughout which abstract concepts are
        substantiated with concrete examples in the Haskell programming
        language. A collection of Bash shell scripts was also developed to
        facilitate effective management and deployment of this project.

        \item \githublink{cv}{Curriculum Vitae}: The sources of my CV
        demonstrate understanding of imperative and declarative design
        principles for non-trivial typesetting tasks.
    \end{itemize}
    \item A familiarity with the Wolfram \textit{Mathematica} technical
    computing system, particularly in the research areas of Automated
    Theorem-Proving and Distributed Workflows. A small cache of
    \textit{Mathematica} notebooks can be found on
    \weblink{misc\_mma}{my University web instance}.
\end{itemize}
