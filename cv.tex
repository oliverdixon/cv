\phantomsection\addcontentsline{toc}{section}{Summary}
I am a Mathematics and Computer Science joint honours undergraduate student at
the University of York, currently seeking a Year in Industry while averaging
over 80\% in academic disciplines. In addition to having a keen and
long-established interest in Mathematics and Theoretical Computer Science, I am
well-versed in a diverse range of practical technologies including C, C++, Java,
Haskell, \LaTeX{}, SQL, Python, and a variety of other scripting languages.
These act in complement to my demonstrable abilities in strong leadership,
communication, and organisation. I am enthusiastic to participate in a
high-pressure and client-oriented environment, and I anticipate to exploit my
problem-solving and analytical skills, gained through the study of Mathematics
and a decade of software-development experience, to devise efficient solutions
that satisfy clients' criteria.

\section{Technical Skills}
Whilst I am constantly concerned with the continual development of my commercial
and managerial aptitude, a wide variety of experiences has allowed me to
ascertain a significant set of skills bound to be invaluable to any employer.
\begin{itemize}
    \item Expertise---substantiated by over a decade's experience---in the C,
        C++, and Java programming languages, the latter of which have allowed me
        to form a solid understanding of modern object-oriented design patterns,
        particularly in the context of embedded and bare-metal platforms.
        Some expositions of relevant work can be found on GitHub and my
        University website; brief descriptions are provided below.
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \compactlink{\webprefix pss}{Programming Support Sessions}: During
            my tenure as the Technical Director of the University of York
            Electronics Society (\textit{EngSoc}, formerly \textit{ShockSoc})
            throughout 2022, I compiled and delivered a full course of the C
            programming language to large cohorts of undergraduate students
            studying various branches of Engineering.

            During the orchestration of this project, in the interests of
            securing a successful execution, I demonstrated impeccable long-term
            organisational and leadership skills: this included administration
            of the Societal and Departmental assets, and management of all
            interested parties.

        \item \compactlink{\ghprefix calculator-demo}{A Work-In-Progress
            Computer Algebra System}: This project unifies efficient and refined
            implementations of algorithms that are integral for mathematical
            computing applications, such as the parsing of expressions and
            stack-based evaluation. The codebase is under active development,
            with the eventual goal of producing a comprehensive system capable
            of general technical computing.

        \item \compactlink{\webprefix fractal}{A Hardware-Accelerated Fractal
            Renderer}: This product, coupled with a large report, was written
            for an A-level Computer Science qualification, however continues to
            be maintained in a limited capacity. Using C, OpenGL, and assembly
            language on a 64-bit Linux platform, the final product was capable
            of rendering parametrisable fractals using distributed computing
            paradigms.

        \item \compactlink{\ghgprefix}{GitHub Gists Library}: A collection of
            modular and extensible implementations of standard algorithms and
            abstract data structures which pervade classical Computer Science
            and Software Engineering. Selected contributions include a Hamming
            Weight benchmarking toolkit, an optimised implementation of a
            string-formatter, and a visual demonstration of dynamic allocation,
            intended for the education of undergraduate Computer Science and
            Electronic Engineering students.
    \end{itemize}
    \item Through my long involvement in open-source communities, and working in
    University special-interest societies, I have established an understanding
    of foundational team-based development processes including agile and
    continuous techniques. I strongly value, and continually endeavour to
    improve, the qualities of efficient communication amongst small teams when
    working collaboratively: this includes experience with unit testing in a
    large selection of languages, including for projects using multiple stacks
    requiring uniform testing.

    \item A matured acquaintance with the \TeX\ and \LaTeX\ typesetting systems.
    In addition to the aforementioned Programming Support Session scripts, which
    were wholly set with \LaTeX, I have an array of similarly technical
    document-preparation projects:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \compactlink{\ghprefix MS1GP}{\textit{Mathematical Skills} Group
            Project}: A small set of documents covering Category Theory, with a
            particular focus on its parallels to functional programming. The
            repository includes a report and large presentation, throughout
            which abstract concepts are substantiated with concrete examples in
            the Haskell programming language. A collection of Bash shell scripts
            was also developed to facilitate effective management and deployment
            of this project.

        \item \compactlink{\ghprefix cv}{Curriculum Vitae}: The sources of my CV
            demonstrate understanding of imperative and declarative design
            principles for non-trivial typesetting tasks.
    \end{itemize}
    \item A familiarity with the Wolfram \textit{Mathematica} technical
        computing system, particularly in the research areas of Automated
        Theorem-Proving and Distributed Workflows. A small cache of
        \textit{Mathematica} notebooks can be found on \compactlink{\webprefix
        misc\_mma}{my University web instance}.
\end{itemize}
